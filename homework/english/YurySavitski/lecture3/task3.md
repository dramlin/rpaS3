"Good morning students! Today I want to talk about application development. As you know, to begin you need a good computer with solid components. Having the right hardware will help you to develop quality software that works without crashing.
I always follow certain rules when I build a new app:
1. The data for the application should be stored in a relational database
2. Customers should be able to buy my application on the Internet
3. The software should work without any extra peripherals
